# README BEFORE YOU START SCREAMING AND BREAKING THINGS !!!
#
# MSVC: /Zc:whchar-t  option was set on in the boost-build\tools\msvc.jam file
#       however this option was not on when I built Qt library. If /Zc:wchar-t is 
#       on wchar_t is as a native type instead of a typedef for unsigned short and 
#       linking against Qt fails (QString::fromStdWString(...), & QString::FromWCharArray
#       
#       Qt was built without debug libraries but when a debug version of this release
#       is built boost.build expects debug versions of qtlibs (i.e. QtCored4.dll).
#       -> copy+rename qt libs
#
#       
# qt4.jam: qt4.jam file turns on QT_NO_DEBUG flag. I have commented this out in /usr/share/boost-build/qt4.jam
#
# 
# Other notes: 
# 
# Moving Qt from it's installation folder will break the installation. Don't do that.
